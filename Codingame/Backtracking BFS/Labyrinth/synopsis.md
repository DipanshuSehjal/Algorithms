Lt. Sulu: “After scanning the area, it appears that the tracker beam holding the ship down originates from a large metallic structure buried beneath the surface. The scans show that the structure contains hollow parts so I think someone could be teleported inside and reach what appears to be a control room. Unfortunately I cannot pinpoint the exact location of this control room due to massive interferences.”

Spock: “Captain, it is only logical to assume that this is another trap. I would not recommend sending anyone in there without further analyzing the situation.”

Kirk: “Spock, we are too much at risk stranded on this planet, at the mercy of anyone. I am going in!”

Lt. Sulu: “Captain, scanners shows some kind of mechanical activity in the walls of the structure. I would not recommend touching them.”

Kirk: “Understood! Then I will use a jet pack to navigate within the structure.”

Kirk, activating his comlink: “Scotty, beam me down.”

Scotty: “Aye, sir. But whatever you do down there, you have to come back at your starting location. Otherwise the interferences wiil prevent me from getting a lock on you and transporting you back up.”

Kirk: “OK. All set... Energize...”
