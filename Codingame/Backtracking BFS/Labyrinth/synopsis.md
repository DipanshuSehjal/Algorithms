This puzzle is all about exploring a 2D grid in an optimized way. You may implement BFS and a pathfinding algorithm such as A* to find the shortest path between two tiles.

## Statement
The goal of this puzzle is to explore a map with a fog-of-war until you have found a point of interest and the best path to get back. Take all the time you need on exploration (Breadth First Search) because you will need to be certain to have the shortest path to get back to the entrance from the point of interest (Pathfinding)


**Lt. Sulu:** “After scanning the area, it appears that the tracker beam holding the ship down originates from a large metallic structure buried beneath the surface. The scans show that the structure contains hollow parts so I think someone could be teleported inside and reach what appears to be a control room. Unfortunately I cannot pinpoint the exact location of this control room due to massive interferences.”

**Spock:** “Captain, it is only logical to assume that this is another trap. I would not recommend sending anyone in there without further analyzing the situation.”

**Kirk:** “Spock, we are too much at risk stranded on this planet, at the mercy of anyone. I am going in!”

**Lt. Sulu:** “Captain, scanners shows some kind of mechanical activity in the walls of the structure. I would not recommend touching them.”

**Kirk:** “Understood! Then I will use a jet pack to navigate within the structure.”

**Kirk, activating his comlink:** “Scotty, beam me down.”

**Scotty:** “Aye, sir. But whatever you do down there, you have to come back at your starting location. Otherwise the interferences wiil prevent me from getting a lock on you and transporting you back up.”

**Kirk:** “OK. All set... Energize...”
