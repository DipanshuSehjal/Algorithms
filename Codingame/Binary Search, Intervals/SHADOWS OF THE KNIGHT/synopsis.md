## The goal: 
Batman will look for the hostages on a given building by jumping from one window to another using his grapnel gun. Batman's goal is to jump to the window where the hostages are located in order to disarm the bombs. Unfortunately he has a limited number of jumps before the bombs go off...

** Batman: ** “Come on Joker, give it up, I know you're hiding in here somewhere, you can't escape from me.”

** Joker: ** “Oh, but I think I can Batman! Just look behind you. See these buildings over there? In each one of them there is a room full of hostages trapped with my sweet little Joker-BOMBS. They are about to go off any minute now in a marvellous firework! KA-BOOOM!!!”

** Batman: ** “Damn you Joker, you won't get away with this.”

** Joker: ** “So what will it be Batman? Do you want to waste time chasing me or will you try to save the poor, poor hostages? I'd hurry if I were you...Ha-ha-ha”

** Batman: ** “Alfred, I don't have time to check all the buildings' windows: I need a gadget to help me.”

** Alfred: ** “Certainly sir. I have the perfect device: it can track the bombs heat signature. I'm sending it to you as soon as I'm done reprogramming it.”

** Joker: ** “So long Batman! Ha-ha-ha OH-OH-OH...”
