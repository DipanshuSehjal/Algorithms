## STORY

Marvin is stuck inside the core of the Infinite Improbability Drive! Grab your towel and help him (or them) escape by blocking the right clones to allow others to reach the exit by going through the right Happy Vertical People Transporters.

## The goal:

You need to help Marvin and his clones (or is it the other way round?) reach the exit in order to help them escape the inside of the Infinite Improbability Drive.



**Marvin A:**  “I do wish the Hitchhiker hadn't pressed that button, now I'm stuck inside the core of the Infinite Improbability Drive. There seems to be another me standing in front of me... no wait, there are 2 other mes now. At this rate they'll be an infinite number of Marvins clogging up the Heart Of Gold's engines.  ”

**Marvin B:**  “I suppose we should probably rescue the ship from being destroyed now. Total waste of time if you ask me, not that anyone ever bothers to ask me anything. ”

**Marvin A:**  “I've been cloned. I mean we've been cloned. But the process seems to have gone somewhat haywire.  ”

**Marvin C:**  “Indeed, I feel more intelligent than before. This is quite a feat considering I originally had a brain the size of a planet! I can sense the infinite expanse of the universe inside my mind, and I think you should all know that I'm feeling very depressed. ”

**Marvin D:**  “Oh look, the failsafe protocols have activated the emergency Kill-O-Zap lasers. ”

**Marvin E:**  “Lasers? Don't talk to me about lasers... ”

**Marvin B:**  “We can escape by using the Happy Vertical People Transporters that are popping into existence. I hate those talking elevators so much, I deactivated all of their speaking circuits. ”

**Marvin F:**  “To avoid a sudden total existence failure, we should follow one another in a straight line, the leading Marvin can signal the danger to the rest of us. ”

**Marvin E:**  “We can't all escape. I'm sure to be left behind once again. Me with this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side... ”

**Marvin C:**  “Wrong! Since we are all the same entity along the probability axis, as soon as one of us makes it outside, normality will be restored and we will survive as one to continue our pitiful existence. ”

**Marvin F:**  “How many of us are there now ? ”

**Marvin A:**  “41 ”

**Marvin C:**  “You idiot! You forgot to count yourself. ”

**Marvin A:**  “Let's just go... ”
