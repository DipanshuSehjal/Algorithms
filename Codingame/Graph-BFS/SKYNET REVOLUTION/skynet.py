What will I learn: 
In this puzzle, you will learn to store data in a graph data structure. Searching through and updating the graph youâ€™ve created will help you get to grips with Graph Theory.

External resources Graph TheoryBreadth First Search 

The goal:
Your virus has caused a backdoor to open on the Skynet network enabling you to send new instructions in real time.

You decide to take action by stopping Skynet from communicating on its own internal network.

Skynet's network is divided into several smaller networks, in each sub-network is a Skynet agent tasked with transferring information by moving from node to node along links and accessing gateways leading to other sub-networks.

Your mission is to reprogram the virus so it will sever links in such a way that the Skynet Agent is unable to access another sub-network thus preventing information concerning the presence of our virus to reach Skynet's central hub.

        a starting node, and returns an iterable of 2-tuples
        of the form (node, distance) produced
        by performing a breadth-first search starting at the
        specified node.
        BFS is a traversing algorithm where you should start
        traversing from a selected
        node (source or starting node) and
        traverse the graph layerwise
        thus exploring the neighbour nodes (nodes which are directly connected to
        source node). You must then move towards the
        next-level neighbour nodes.
        As the name BFS suggests,
        BFS traverses the graph breadthwise as follows:
        1. First move horizontally and visit all the nodes of the current layer
        2. Move to the next layer
        Pseudo Code:
        BFS (G, s)                   //Where G is the graph and s is the source node
        Initialize all vertices with distance +inf and color = white
        color of s = gray ( mark s as visited )
        distance of s = 0
        Q.enqueue( s )
          while ( Q is not empty)
               //Removing that vertex from queue,whose neighbour will be visited now
               v  =  Q.dequeue( )
              //processing all the neighbours of v
              for all neighbours w of v in Graph G
                   if w is not visited
                            Q.enqueue( w ) //Stores w in Q to further visit its neighbour
