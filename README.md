# Algorithms
This repository houses solutions to some of the algorithm questions running the gamut from various online/offline competitive programming challenges, online coding websites, and personal collection of questions.

You may find some of these solutions helpful when solving programming questions, preparing for technical interviews, or learning to expand your knowledge and skillsets. Some of the popular websites include codingame.com, hackerrank.com, leetcode.com, geeksforgeeks.org, spoj.com and other online resources. I gravitate myself to share the codes only for medium and higher degree of difficulty, specified explicitly with questions on these websites. 

After solving problems for quite a long now, I realized that I am not helpful to the community. I know that feeling of doubt while trying to figure out the missing piece of the puzzle, feeling of getting in the description of the problem, and sometimes just a lack of motivation from a good pal.

Hence, I decided to share my series of work in a hope that someday, sometime, someone might find a ray of sunshine from them. It keeps me motivated to solve more and more problems, and share it with you all.

Happy Exploring! Time to rev up your game!
